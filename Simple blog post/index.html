            <p>
                In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.

Introduction to Fatihah
- This Surah is called Al Fatihah, which means the opener of the Book
- Other names are “Umm Al-Kitab (mother of the Book)”, “Ash-Shifa (the cure)” and “Ar Ruqyah (the remedy)”
How many ayahs does this Surah have?
- There is no disagreement that there are 7 verses in this Surah 
- Majority of the reciters of Al Kufah (a group of the sahabah), the Tabi’in (students of the Sahabah) and many scholars agree that the Basmallah is considered the first ayah of this Surah 
Number of words and letters in this Surah
- Scholars say that this Surah contains 25 words and 113 letters
Why is this Surah called Umm Al-Kitab?
- The Quran starts with this Surah and salah begins with the recitation of this Surah
- It is an Arab tradition to call any comprehensive matter that contains several specific areas an Umm
- Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurairah narrated about Umm Al-Qur'an that the Prophet ﷺ said, «هِيَ أُمُّ الْقُرْآنِ وَهِيَ السَّبْعُ الْمَثَانِي وَهِيَ الْقُرْآنُ الْعَظِيمُ» (It is Umm Al-Qur'an, the seven repeated (verses) and the Glorious Qur'an.)</p>

<p>What are the virtues of Al Fatihah
- Many Hadiths from the messenger of Allah ﷺ saying that Al Fatihah is the greatest Surah in the Quran 
- The likes of this Surah has never been revealed in the Torah (Taurat) or Gospel (Injeel)
- Scholars say that these Hadiths are proof that some verses and surahs of the Quran have more virtue than others 
- This Surah was used for Ruqyah</p>
<p>Al Fatihah in relation to Salah
- Recorded by Imam Muslim, Abu Hurairah narrated that the messenger of Allah ﷺ said, “Whoever performs any prayer in which he did not read Umm Al-Quran, then his prayer is incomplete” he said this 3 times. 
- Even when standing behind the Imam you must recite Al Fatihah 
- Allah responds to us when we recite Al Fatihah 
- When we recite “All praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of existence” Allah responds saying, “My servant has praised Me”
- When we recite “The most gracious, the most merciful”, Allah responds saying, “My servant has glorified Me”
- When we recite “The owner of the day of recompense”, Allah responds saying, “My servant has related all matters to Me”
- When we recite “You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help”, Allah responds saying, “This is between Me and My servant, and My servant shall acquire what he sought”
- When we recite saying “Guide us to the straight path, The path of those on whom You have granted Your grace, not the path of those who went astray”, Allah responds saying, “This is My servant, and My servant shall acquire what he asked for”
- Reciting Al Fatihah is a pillar of every rakah of salah. Your salah is invalid if you miss the recitation of Al Fatihah even in one rakah</p>

<p>Tafsir of Isti`adhah (seeking refuge before reciting Quran)
- Isti’adhah “I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan
- Allah says in the Quran, “Show forgivenesss, enjoin what is good, and stay away from the foolish. And if the evil whisperer comes to you from Shaytan(Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing” (Quran 7:199-200)
- Imam Ahmed recorded a Hadith from Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri where he described the Messenger of Allah ﷺ during his night prayer in which he supplicated seeking refuge with Allah from Shaytan
- One should also seek refuge with Allah when angry
- Majority of scholars are of the opinion that seeking refuge with Allah from Shaytan in prayer or in recitation of the Quran is not required, but recommended. 
- Some virtues of seeking refuge is that it cleanses the mouth from foul speech, purifies and prepares the mouth to recite the words of Allah, it entails that the servant is seeking Allah’s help and acknowledges Allah’s ability to do everything. The Isti’adhah also affirms that the servant is weak and All power belongs to Allah. It is Allah who created Shaytan and it is Allah who can defeat Shaytan.</p>
<p>Why is the devil called Shaytan
    - Shaytan derives from the word “Shatan” which means Far thing. The name Shaytan implies that he is far from the nature of mankind and his sinful ways are fare from every type of righteousness 
    - Those who are rebellious from among the jinn and mankind are called a “Shaytan”
    - Ar Rajeem means being expelled from all types of righteousness </p>
<p>Basmallah aloud in prayer
    - Scholars who believe that the basmallah is an ayah part of the surah also believe the basmallah should be recited during prayer 
    - The scholars who stated that Bismillah is a part of every Surah (except chapter 9) had different opinions; some of them, such as Ash-Shafi" i, said that one should recite Bismillah with Al-Fatihah aloud. This is also the opinion of many among the Companions, the Tabi in and the Imams of Muslims from the Salaf and the later generations.
    - Other scholars stated that the Bismillah should not be recited aloud in the prayer, and this is the established practice of the Four Khalifahs, as well as 'Abdullah bin Mughaffal and several scholars among the Tabi in and later generations. It is also the Madhhab (view) of Abu Hanifah, Ath-Thawri and Ahmad bin Hanbal.
    - The Basmallah is also recommended before doing any deed such as ablution, eating, starting a speech etc
    </p>
    <p>What is the meaning of ALLAH
        Allah is the Name of the Lord, the Exalted. It is said that Allah is the Greatest Name of Allah, because it is referred to when describing Allah by the various attributes. For instance, Allah said,
        
        (He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He) the Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the King, the Holy, the One free from all defects, the Giver of security, the Watcher over His creatures, the Almighty, the Compeller, the Supreme. Glory be to Allah! (High is He) above all that they associate as partners with Him. He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the Almighty, the Wise) (59:22-24).
        
        Recording by Abu Hurairah, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said “Allah has ninety-nine Names, one hundred minus one, whoever counts and preserves them, will enter paradise.
        
        Meaning of Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim - The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
        - Two names derived from Ar Rahmah (the mercy) but Rahman has more meaning pertaining to mercy than Ar Rahim
        - Abu Ali Al Farisi said that Ar Rahman was a name exclusively for Allah and is a name that encompasses every type of mercy that Allah has. Ar Brahim is what effects the believer 
        - Ar Rahman carries a broader scope of meanings pertaining to the mercy of Allah whereas Ar Rajin is a mercy exclusive to the believers</p>

                All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds,
                
                Meaning of Al-Hamd
                
                - Defined by Abu Ja’far bin Jarir
                - All praises and thanks are due to Allah alone
                - Due to all the bounties and favors of Allah upon him creation
                - No one or nothing deserves more praise than Allah
                - This praise is a praise that Allah has praised himself with and is also an indication that we as his servants should praise him as such
                - Has mentioned that Umar said to Ali, “We know La ilaha illallah, Subhan Allah and Allah Akbar. What about Al-Hamdu Lillah? Ali said, “A statement that Allah liked for Himself, was pleased with for Himself and He likes that it be repeated. Also, Ibn Abbas said, “Al-Hamdu Lillah is the statement of appreciation. When the servant says Al-Hamdu Lillah, Allah says, “My servant has praised Me.” Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this Hadith.
                
                Virtues of Al-Hamd
                - A phrase that Allah likes
                - Narrated by Anas bin Malik, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, “The best dhikr is La ilaha illallah and the best supplication is Al-Hamdi Lillah
                
                ‎يا رب لك الحمد كما ينبغي لجلال وجهك ولعظيم سلطانك
                
                Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (radiyallahu ‘anhuma) reports that Nabi (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) informed them:
                “Once a certain slave of Allah said ‘Ya Rabbi, Lakal hamdu kama yambaghi li jalali wajhika wa li ‘azimi sultanika’. (O Allah, All praise belongs to you, as befits the Glory of Your Countenance and the greatness of Your Might.)
                The Angels were uncertain and did not know how to write down [the reward of this]. They ascended to the sky and said, ‘ O our Rabb, Your slave has uttered such a statement we are unsure how to write down [the reward]. Allah then said – and He knows best what His slave said -, ‘What did my slave say’?
                The Angels reply, ‘He said  ‘Ya Rabbi, Lakal hamdu kama yambaghi li jalali wajhika wa li ‘azimi sultanika’.
                Allah Ta’ala then said, ‘Write it down just as my servant has uttered it until he meets Me and I shall reward him for it.'”</p>

                    Pharaoh asked, “And what is ‘the Lord of all worlds’?”
                    
                    ‎قَالَ رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ ۖ إِن كُنتُم مُّوقِنِينَ 
                    Moses replied, “˹He is˺ the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, if only you had sure faith.”

                Indicating Sovereignty on the Day of Judgement

                An-Naba - Verse 38
                
                ‎يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ صَفًّا لَّا يَتَكَلَّمُونَ إِلَّا مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَقَالَ صَوَابًا
                
                on the Day the ˹holy˺ spirit and the angels will stand in ranks. None will talk, except those granted permission by the Most Compassionate and whose words are true.
                
                
                Taha - Verse 108
                
                ‎يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَّبِعُونَ الدَّاعِيَ لَا عِوَجَ لَهُ وَخَشَعَتِ الْأَصْوَاتُ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ فَلَا تَسْمَعُ إِلَّا هَمْسًا
                
                On that Day all will follow the caller ˹for assembly˺, ˹and˺ none will dare to deviate. All voices will be hushed before the Most Compassionate. Only whispers will be heard.
                
                
                Hud - Verse 105
                
                ‎يَوْمَ يَأْتِ لَا تَكَلَّمُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ فَمِنْهُمْ شَقِيٌّ وَسَعِيدٌ
                
                When that Day arrives, no one will dare speak except with His permission. Some of them will be miserable, others joyful.
                
                Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn 'Abbas commented,
                "Allah says, On that Day, no one owns anything that they used to own in the world.'"

                   He is Allah—there is no god except Him: the King, the Most Holy, the All-Perfect, 
                   
                   
                   Abu Hurairah recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, “The most despicable name to Allah is a person who calls himself the king of kings, while there are no owners except Allah)
                   
                   Allah also says in the Quran,
                   
                   Ghafir - Verse 16

                   the Day all will appear ˹before Allah˺. Nothing about them will be hidden from Him. ˹He will ask,˺ “Who does all authority belong to this Day? To Allah—the One, the Supreme!
                   
                   The meaning of Ad-Din
                   - Ad-Din means the reckoning, the reward or punishment. 
                   
                   Allah says in the Quran,
                   
                   An-Nur - Verse 25
                   
                   ‎يَوْمَئِذٍ يُوَفِّيهِمُ اللَّهُ دِينَهُمُ الْحَقَّ وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ الْمُبِينُ
                   
                   On that Day, Allah will give them their just penalty in full, and they will ˹come to˺ know that Allah ˹alone˺ is the Ultimate Truth.
                   
                   “The wise person is he who reckons himself and works for his life after death (by holding himself accountable). Also Umar said, “Hold yourself account before you are held accountable, weigh yourselves before you are weighed, and be prepared for the biggest gathering before He Whose knowledge encompasses all your deeds,
                   
                   Al-Haqqah - Verse 18
                   
                   ‎يَوْمَئِذٍ تُعْرَضُونَ لَا تَخْفَىٰ مِنكُمْ خَافِيَةٌ
                   
                   You will then be presented ˹before Him for judgment˺, and none of your secrets will stay hidden.

            <p>
                You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help.
                
                
                
                
                Linguistic and Religious meaning of عبادة
                
                - Means subdued
                - Implies utmost love, humility and fear, religiously
                
                
                Merit of stating the object of the action before the doer of the Act
                
                - We worship You alone and none else and rely on You alone and none else
                - Remember when Ustaz Abdul Rashid gave the analogy of love. I love you may imply that you love other people where as You alone I love implies the love is only for one person
                - Considered perfect form of obedience and Islam is based on these two ideas
                - First part is condemning shirk while second part negates any power or strength and recognizes that Allah is the controller of all affairs
                - Note that ayah the speech changes from 3rd person to direct speech. The servant goes from praising Allah to addressing Allah directly
                - This surah indicates the necessity to praise Allah, therefore it is required in every prayer
                
                Allah says in the Quran,
                
                Hud - Verse 123
                
                ‎وَلِلَّهِ غَيْبُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُ الْأَمْرُ كُلُّهُ فَاعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ
                
                To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the knowledge of what is hidden in the heavens and the earth. And to Him all matters are returned. So worship Him and put your trust in Him. And your Lord is never unaware of what you do.</p>

                <p>Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that An-Nawwas bin Sam`an said that the Prophet ﷺ said,

                    ‎«ضَرَبَ اللهُ مَثَلًا صِرَاطًا مُسْتَقِيمًا، وَعَلَى جَنْبَتَيِ الصِّرَاطِ سُورَانِ فِيهِمَا أَبْوَابٌ مُفَتَّحَةٌ، وَعَلَى الْأَبْوَابِ سُتُورٌ مُرْخَاةٌ، وَعَلَى بَابِ الصِّرَاطِ دَاعٍ يَقُولُ: يَاأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ ادْخُلُوا الصِّرَاطَ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَعْوَجُّوا، وَدَاعٍ يَدْعُو مِنْ فَوْقِ الصِّرَاطِ، فَإِذَا أَرَادَ الْإِنْسَانُ أَنْ يَفْتَحَ شَيْئًا مِنْ تِلْكَ الْأَبْوَابِ قَالَ:وَيْحَكَ لَا تَفْتَحْهُ فَإِنَّكَ إِنْ فَتَحْتَهُ تَلِجْهُ فَالصِّرَاطُ: الْإِسْلَامُ وَالسُّورَانِ: حُدُودُ اللهِ وَالْأَبْوَابُ الْمُفَتَّحَةُ مَحَارِمُ اللهِ وَذَلِكَ الدَّاعِي عَلَى رَأْسِ الصِّرَاطِ كِتَابُ اللهِ، وَالدَّاعِي مِنْ فَوْقِ الصِّرَاطِ وَاعِظُ اللهِ فِي قَلْبِ كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ»
                    
                    (Allah has set an example: a Sirat (straight path) that is surrounded by two walls on both sides, with several open doors within the walls covered with curtains. There is a caller on the gate of the Sirat who heralds, 'O people! Stay on the path and do not deviate from it.' Meanwhile, a caller from above the path is also warning any person who wants to open any of these doors, 'Woe unto you! Do not open it, for if you open it you will pass through.' The straight path is Islam, the two walls are Allah's set limits, while the doors resemble what Allah has prohibited. The caller on the gate of the Sirat is the Book of Allah, while the caller above the Sirat is Allah's admonishment in the heart of every Muslim.)

                the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.
                
                Who did Allah bestow his grace upon?
                
                An-Nisa - Verse 69
                
                ‎وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ وَالصَّالِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَٰئِكَ رَفِيقًا
                
                And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger will be in the company of those blessed by Allah: the prophets, the people of truth, the martyrs, and the righteous—what honourable company!
                
                An-Nisa - Verse 70
                
                ‎ذَٰلِكَ الْفَضْلُ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ عَلِيمًا
                
                This is Allah’s favour, and Allah fully knows ˹who deserves it˺.
                
                
                - The straight path is the path that Allah has bestowed his grace upon
                - Examples of the people of guidance include the Prophets, the people of truth, the martyrs and the righteous 
                - They adhere to the commandments of Allah and refrain from what is prohibited by Allah
                - We should avoid the path of those whom Allah is displeased with; those with corrupt intentions, the christians and the jews 
                - Anger descended upon the jews while the christians are described as being led astray
                - Those who know but avoid implementing the truth deserve the anger
